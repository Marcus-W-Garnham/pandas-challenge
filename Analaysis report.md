Observations:

1. By looking at the 'Scores by School Type' result we made and the by looking at the 'top five schools' and 'worst five schools' we can see something very interesting. We see that charter schools out perform district schools. Reading and math are both below what charter schools get but its usally math that is worse on average than reading when compared. 

2. Also by looking at the top and bottom performing schools we can also see that the top performing schools have a lower student population than the bottom perferoming schools.

3. Also by looking at the top and bottom performing schools we can see that budget per student doesn't mean higher grades as they have similar budgets per student. In fact the bottom performing schools spend slightly more then the top performing schools on each student. Only two schools in the top perofrming schools pay around what the bottom performing schools pay per student.

4. Looking at the district summary we made in the first part of our code we see that more students pass reading than they do math. In fact 10% less students pass math and the overall math score is lower than reading.
